# Story 16: Achieve 100% Evaluator Code Coverage

- **Project**: `template-engine-ts`
- **Status**: `verified completed`
- **As a** QA Engineer / Principal Engineer,
- **I want to** ensure 100% code coverage for the `src/evaluator.ts` module,
- **so that** all logic paths, including edge cases and error conditions, are rigorously tested, guaranteeing the highest quality for our core templating logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `src/evaluator.ts` achieves 100% statement, branch, and function coverage as reported by Vitest.
- Specific tests are added to cover:
  - Evaluation of `null` or `undefined` AST nodes.
  - Evaluation of a standalone `ArrayNode` (which should throw an error as it's an invalid state).
  - Cross-product iteration over an array containing non-Map elements (e.g., primitive values like strings or numbers).
  - Evaluation of an unknown or unhandled AST node type (which should throw an error).
- All new tests are placed in a dedicated coverage test file (e.g., `test/evaluator-coverage.test.ts`).

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: "Achieve and maintain 100% code coverage for `src/evaluator.ts`."
- **Secondary Metrics**: "Zero new bugs reported against the evaluator module after implementing these tests."
