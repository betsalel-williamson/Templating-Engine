# Our Engineering Philosophy

This repository contains the principles, processes, and standards that guide our software development lifecycle. Our methodology is based on proven practices that correlate with high-performing teams, as identified by years of DORA research.

Our goal is not just to deliver software, but to deliver value reliably, sustainably, and efficiently.

## Core Tenets

1.  **Be Relentlessly User-Centric**: Our work begins and ends with the user. Understanding user needs is not a secondary task; it is the primary driver of product quality and developer satisfaction. We build for impact.

2.  **Maintain Small Batch Sizes**: The single most effective way to maintain delivery velocity and stability is to keep changes small, atomic, and logical. This is especially critical in an era of AI-assisted code generation.

3.  **Use Data-Informed Decision Making**: We use a specific set of metrics (see `docs/metrics`) to understand our performance and guide improvement. We use data to test hypotheses, not to judge teams or individuals.

4.  **Embrace Continuous Improvement**: Our process is a continuous loop of identifying opportunities, measuring baselines, hypothesizing changes, executing, and measuring outcomes. We expect to see an initial performance dip (the "J-Curve") when adopting new processes, followed by significant gains.

5.  **Practice Technical Excellence**: Our architecture and code adhere to strict principles of statelessness, loose coupling, and designing for failure. The path to production is fully automated.

This is a living document. We use it to guide our work and onboard new engineers.
