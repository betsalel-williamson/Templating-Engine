- **As an** Engineering Team,
- **I want to** use build scripts that are fully cross-platform compatible,
- **so that** our CI/CD pipeline runs reliably on all operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) without platform-specific errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `npm run build` command must execute successfully on a clean checkout on Windows, macOS, and Linux runners.
- Native shell commands with known platform inconsistencies (like `mkdir -p`) must be replaced with cross-platform equivalents from the Node.js ecosystem (e.g., `mkdirp`).
- The CI pipeline must not produce any shell-specific errors related to file or directory creation.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: "Change Failure Rate for the CI pipeline is reduced to 0% for build-script-related issues."
- **Secondary Metrics**: "Developer time spent debugging platform-specific CI failures is reduced."
