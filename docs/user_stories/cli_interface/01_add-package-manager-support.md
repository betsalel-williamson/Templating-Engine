# Story 13: Package CLI for Distribution

- **Project**: `template-engine-ts`
- **As a** Developer,
- **I want to** install the CLI tool using standard package managers like Homebrew,
- **so that** I can simplify installation and updates of the tool across different developer machines and CI environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A Homebrew formula for the CLI is created and published to a tap.
- `brew install our-org/tap/template-engine` successfully installs the CLI.
- Installation instructions for Homebrew are added to the `README.md`.
- (Optional) A pipeline is created to automatically publish new versions to Homebrew on release.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: "Time to onboard a new developer to a project using the CLI is reduced by 5 minutes."
- **Secondary Metrics**: "Increase adoption of the CLI tool by 50% across the organization."
