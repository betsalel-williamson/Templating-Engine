# Story 13: Add Markdown Code Block Syntax Highlighting

- **Project**: `template-engine-ts`
- **As a** Developer / Technical Writer,
- **I want to** display code examples within markdown files (like `README.md` and `docs/`) with proper syntax highlighting,
- **so that** code is easily readable, understood, and visually distinct from surrounding text, improving documentation quality and reducing cognitive load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Code blocks in our markdown files with our new template language identifiers must render with accurate syntax highlighting in standard markdown viewers (e.g., GitHub, VS Code).
- The highlighting should correctly differentiate keywords, variables, comments, and strings for the specified languages.
- Ensure that any template syntax examples in markdown are rendered clearly, potentially by wrapping them in generic `text` or `nohighlight` blocks if custom highlighting isn't directly supported.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: "Achieve a 10% increase in documentation 'readability' or 'clarity' scores in internal developer surveys."
- **Secondary Metrics**: "Reduce instances of 'code example unreadable/unformatted' feedback during documentation reviews by 50%."
