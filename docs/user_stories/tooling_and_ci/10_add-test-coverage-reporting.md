# Story 10: Add Test Coverage Reporting

- **Project**: `template-engine-ts`
- **As a** Developer,
- **I want to** integrate test coverage reporting into our test suite,
- **so that** I have a clear, objective measure of our test quality and can identify untested code paths, which is critical for maintaining software delivery stability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The command `npm test -- --coverage` must run successfully and generate a coverage report.
- An HTML report must be generated in a `coverage/` directory, which is added to `.gitignore`.
- The summary report must show >95% statement, branch, and function coverage for all modules in `src/`.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: "Rework Rate for new features remains below 5%, indicating high quality from robust testing."
- **Secondary Metrics**: "Maintain >95% code coverage as a quality gate in CI."
